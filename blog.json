I feel like a fucking Isekai character 'the story how I got reincarnated as a trans puppy girl thats constantly horny'. Looking at the me from just half a year ago this is a completely diffrent person. I like how I turned out or rather how I am turning out but damn its just so diffrent. All I want to do is become a hot bitch that makes men at the beach jealous of my polycule. Taking estrogen is THE best thing that ever happened to me. <3"

  "content": "Gosh being a woman is the best thing ever, I love my emotions and what estrogen does to my body... My thoughts have changed so much since I started taking estrogen, its probably just me being more honest to myself and damn what a difference that makes. I truly feel connected to myself now. I just say what I really think nowadays instead of what I think people want to hear, feels much healthier. Living for myself instead of living for the fear of missing out is also a much diffrent experience. I just want to live like this! I want to be. Everything is so much brighter and more colourful than it ever was before. I still have some hurdles to get over, I NEED bottom surgery for example. I honestly dont think a life with a penis will be a life worth living for me, I can tolerate the thing because I still need it for the surgery but damn I hate it so much. To end on a high node Im going to spend the day with my gf talking and playing games online I am unimaginably happy rn. <3"
